            My name is Bill Todd and I spent most of my life on the east coast but have been residing in Belmont, CA for about five years now. 
            I enjoy being a key player behind the scenes who brings great things (apps, websites, campaigns) to life. 
            I have spent many years working in graphic design of print and digital materials but currently work in email marketing.
            When I'm not working I'm often playing with my two kids or hiking and biking on the trails around here.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am taking CIS-128 because I'm working towards a degree in Computer Science and looking to transition more into a career on the development side.
            And because I'm not completely sure what exactly is the difference is between a website and web app and curious to learn more. 
        </p>
